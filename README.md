# Old-Photo-Restoration-GFP_GANs 
Old Photo Restoration (GFP_GANs)" is a GitHub repository dedicated to the restoration of old and damaged photographs using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This repository contains code and resources for training and utilizing GAN models specifically designed for the task of restoring old photos.ðŸ’­ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository contains resources and code for restoring old and damaged photographs using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our goal is to preserve and enhance historical and sentimental images by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.

## Key Features

- **GAN Model:** Utilizes a specially designed GAN architecture for restoring old photos.
- **Data Preparation:** Includes scripts and tools for preprocessing and augmenting old photo datasets.
- **Training:** Provides code and instructions for training the GAN model on your own dataset.
- **Inference:** Guides on using the trained model to restore and enhance old photos.
